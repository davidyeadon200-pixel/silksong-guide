        <img src="HornetCapture.avif" class="lore-image">
        <div class="lore-overlay">
            <h2>Hornet’s Capture</h2>
            <p>Hornet is ambushed by silk-wrapped enemies and taken in a cage to the distant kingdom of Pharloom. Her capture is deliberate, suggesting someone there specifically needs her.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-section">
        <img src="Pharloom.png" class="lore-image">
        <div class="lore-overlay">
            <h2>The Kingdom of Pharloom</h2>
            <p>Pharloom is a remote kingdom built on silk, song, and religious ascension. Its culture revolves around pilgrimage and climbing the great Citadel.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-section">
        <img src="Grandmother Silk.avif" class="lore-image">
        <div class="lore-overlay">
            <h2>The Silk Queen</h2>
            <p>The Silk Queen commands the Weaves, tying her directly to Hornet’s abductions. Her motives remain unclear but are central to the kingdom’s rituals.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-section">
        <img src="Pilgrims.jpg" class="lore-image">
        <div class="lore-overlay">
            <h2>Pilgrims and the Tower</h2>
            <p>Bugs from across the land travel to Pharloom seeking healing or ascension through the Citadel’s trials. Hornet, unlike them, is forced into this journey.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-section">
        <img src="Silk.png" class="lore-image">
        <div class="lore-overlay">
            <h2>The Role of Silk</h2>
            <p>Silk is a life-giving, binding, and restorative force that replaces Soul both mechanically and thematically. It connects Hornet, the Weavers, and Pharloom’s rituals.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-section">
        <img src="hornet.jpg" class="lore-image">
        <div class="lore-overlay">
            <h2>Hornet’s Identity</h2>
            <p>Hornet’s royal and Weaver heritage makes her uniquely important in Pharloom. Her lineage positions her as either a threat, a tool, or a candidate for ascension.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-section">
        <img src="Corruption.jpg" class="lore-image">
        <div class="lore-overlay">
            <h2>Echoes of Infection</h2>
            <p>Pharloom shows signs of its own corruption or sickness. This mirrors Hallownest’s downfall and suggests a recurring cycle in kingdoms.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-section">
        <img src="song.webp" class="lore-image">
        <div class="lore-overlay">
            <h2>The Power of Song</h2>
            <p>Song is a spiritual and sometimes healing force used by Pharloom’s inhabitants. It acts as a counterpart to silk, shaping the kingdom’s culture and magic.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lore-section">
        <img src="SilksongLogo.webp" class="lore-image">
        <div class="lore-overlay">
            <h2>The Citadel</h2>
            <p>The Citadel is the ultimate destination of Hornet’s journey and the heart of Pharloom’s ascension rituals. Whatever purpose she was brought for awaits her at its peak.</p>
