    <h1>Mechanics</h1>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Healing with Silk</h2>
        <p>Hornet heals by weaving silk into a Bind, restoring health in a single, fast animation. It costs full silk segments, making resource management more tactical than in Hollow Knight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Silk Gauge</h2>
        <p>Defeating enemies and striking foes fills Hornet’s silk spool. Silk fuels healing, abilities, and special attacks, acting as the core resource of the entire combat system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Needle Combat</h2>
        <p>Hornet fights with her needle, giving her longer reach, faster strikes, and more mobility-based combos. Combat is more aggressive and rewards precision and timing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>Tools are reusable items that consume silk to unleash powerful effects like bombs, traps, or mobility boosts. They function like customizable abilities that shape your playstyle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Crafting</h2>
        <p>Hornet can gather materials from enemies and the environment to craft new tools or upgrade existing ones. This adds progression depth and encourages exploration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Movement & Agility</h2>
        <p>Hornet is far more agile than the Knight, with faster dashes, wall-climbs, and aerial control. The game emphasizes speed, fluidity, and acrobatic traversal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Quests</h2>
        <p>NPCs give structured quests that track objectives, rewards, and story progress. This replaces Hollow Knight’s looser NPC interactions with a more guided system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Enemy Hunts</h2>
        <p>Some quests involve tracking specific enemies across multiple areas. These hunts blend exploration and combat, rewarding players with materials or upgrades.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Checkpoints</h2>
        <p>Instead of benches, Hornet uses rest points that save progress and allow tool management. They are placed to support faster, more dynamic gameplay.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Maps & Cartography</h2>
        <p>Hornet collects maps from Shakra and updates them by finding checkpoints. Mapping is streamlined to match the game’s faster pace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Crests</h2>
        <p>Silksong replaces charms with crests, which modify abilities, movement, or combat. Crests offer build variety but are balanced around Hornet’s higher mobility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Enemy Aggression</h2>
        <p>Enemies in Pharloom are faster, more varied, and often use silk-based attacks. Combat pushes the player to stay mobile rather than tank hits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Boss Fights</h2>
        <p>Bosses emphasize multi-phase movement, verticality, and rapid attacks. Hornet’s agility is tested through pattern recognition and quick repositioning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mechanic-block">
        <h2>Ascension System</h2>
        <p>Some areas and challenges are tied to Pharloom’s theme of ascension, offering harder versions of encounters for greater rewards. This acts as optional endgame difficulty.</p>
